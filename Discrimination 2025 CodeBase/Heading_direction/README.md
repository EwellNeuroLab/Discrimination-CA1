# Heading-direction pipeline

## 1. Get HD cells
Input: processed dlc position, CaActivity, and the PCanalysis mat files. Heading direction is calculated with respect to a reference point (N corner) and binned into 45Â° bins. Tuning curves and Rayleigh vectors are calculated, and repeated 500 times after shuffling 1) Ca traces and 2) HD. 

Output: summary table with properties and identified HDCs.


## 2. VectorRemapping
Functions are wrapped up in the live script, use that instead of this folder.
